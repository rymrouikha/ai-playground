# Rym’s AI Lab

A collection of small Jupyter notebooks that document my journey learning AI and Machine Learning.
Each notebook focuses on a single idea or algorithm (from linear regression to basic neural networks),
implemented and explained step-by-step with code, visualizations, and notes.

This repo is intended for learning and demonstration — feel free to browse, run, and adapt the notebooks. And most importantly give your feedback.
